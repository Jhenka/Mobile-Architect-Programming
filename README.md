**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**
The Weight tracking app I created gives the user the ability to store their weight and date of entry to keep track of their goals. The App will also notify them when they reach their goals.
**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
The login screen was important to allow the user to protect their information as well as access only their data entries. The Main screen was important to show all their entries, as well as serve as the root for the rest of the application. The user can click on an entry and modify it or create a new entry. This kept users in mind by being very straightforward and easy to use which in turn assists in user adoption.
**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**
When coding my add I started with an idea and a list of objectives from there I used the Android Studio app to develop a basic layout. From there I began codding the components starting from the databases to the options to access the databases. Then finally I connected the activities to the layouts and performed numerous tests along the way.
**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**
When coding any sort of activity it is important to test to make sure the program performance in a satisfactory way. I tested every method and every variable along the way to make sure variables were called correctly, getters and setters worked and then finally the activity and databases achieved the desired outcomes.
**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
The biggest innovation on my part was the way I went about connecting the database to the user data. I chose to do so by using different activities and spreading the code out a bit. I had different interfaces for adding data, deleting, and updating to make sure everything ran smoothly.
**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**
The main component which I believe showcased my abilities was the login activity and layout. The connection to the authentication database, the layout and usability. It was one of the first thing I built for this app and it performed flawlessly.
